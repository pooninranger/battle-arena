Flock off, feather-face!
Shall we dance?
No one said you could touch!
You want to play with Bayonetta?
Let's dance!
Nice try!
Not quite!
Can't touch me!
Is that all you've got?
Gotcha!
Come on!
I've got a fever, and the only cure is more dead angels!
Almost!
You've been naughty!
Let's rock, baby!
Dancin'-a-go-go, baby!
