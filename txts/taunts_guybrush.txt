You fight like a dairy farmer!
Would you like to be buried or cremated?
I can't rest 'til you've been exterminated!
My attacks have left entire islands depopulated!
Your looks would make pigs nauseated!
Nothing can stop me from blowing you away!
Soon you'll be wearing my sword like a shish kebab!
People fall at my feet when they see me coming.
I once owned a dog that was smarter then you.
Nobody's ever drawn blood from me and nobody ever will.
Have you stopped wearing diapers yet?
You're no match for my brains, you poor fool.
You have the manners of a beggar.
There are no words for how disgusting you are.
I've spoken with apes more polite then you.
I've got a long, sharp lesson for you you to learn today.
My tongue is sharper than any sword 
My name is feared in every dirty corner of this island! 
Only once have I met such a coward! 
If your brother's like you, better to marry a pig. 
Every enemy I've met I've annihilated! 
You're as repulsive as a monkey in a negligee.
Killing you would be justifiable homicide! 
You're the ugliest monster ever created! 
I'll skewer you like a sow at a buffet!
Coming face to face with me must leave you petrified! 
Throughout the Caribbean, my great deeds are celebrated! 
I'll leave you devasted, mutilated, and perforated!
I'll hound you night and day!
