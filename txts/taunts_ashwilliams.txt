Hail to the king, baby!
Come get some.
Groovy!
You see this? This... is my BOOMSTICK!
That's right... who's laughing now... who's laughing *now*!?
Let's head on down into that cellar and carve ourselves a witch.
You're goin' down!
Let's go!
All right you primative screwhead, listen up!
Your pain, my gain!
Hey, nice face! Let me fix it for you!
Whoa! Were you born that ugly?
You're stinking up my town!
Hey ugly, I got something that'll clear that right up.
That can't be your face... Did your neck throw up?
Let's tango.
Rest in pieces, dirt bag.
One look at you and I know why some animals eat thier young.
Sorry, I missed that. You said something about eating my soul?
So, tell me about yourself. Is there a Mrs or Mr Ugly to keep you cold at night?
Hey, wouldn't you just like to sit down and discuss our differences? No? Me neither.
Listen up, shake and bake. I eat evil for breakfast and danger for dinner!
I'm about two ticks away from cleaning your clock!
That's right, shop smart. Shop S-Mart! You got that?!
%enemy $+ , I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store.
Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun.
Hey! What's that you got on your face?
Run home and cry to mama!
Say hello to the twenty-first century!
Hey %enemy $+ , your shoe lace is untied!
Well hello Mister Fancypants!
